## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Running QUIL Node with ceremonyclient service
- sudo access for log reading
- Active internet connection for price data

## Installation

## Installation

Navigate to your node directory defalt being ceremonyclient/node
1. Download the script directly to your node directory:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolfcubecho/quil-monitor/main/quil_monitor.py && chmod +x quil_monitor.py
```
or using wget:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolfcubecho/quil-monitor/main/quil_monitor.py && chmod +x quil_monitor.py
```

2. Install required package:
```bash
sudo pip3 install requests
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
sudo python3 quil_monitor.py
```

## Data Storage

The script stores historical data in `quil_metrics.json` in the same directory as the script. This file tracks:
- Daily balances
- Shard metrics
- Historical performance data

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for:
- Node binary detection and access
- Service log reading
- Price API connectivity
- Data parsing and calculations

## Automatic Updates

The script automatically detects and uses the latest node binary in your directory, ensuring compatibility with node updates.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. "Permission denied"
   ```bash
   Solution: Run the script with sudo
   ```

2. "No node binary found"
   ```bash
   Solution: Ensure script is in the same directory as your node binary
   ```

3. "Error getting QUIL price"
   ```bash
   Solution: Check internet connection and CoinGecko API access
   ```

4. "Error getting metrics"
   ```bash
   Solution: Verify ceremonyclient service is running
            Check journalctl access permissions
   ```
